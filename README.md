# FishJawnScraper
wiki scraper for fishjawn db data

So far succesfully navigates list of links pulled from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life_of_New_York%E2%80%93New_Jersey_Harbor_Estuary and builds a minimal profile for 52 fish (only description from first paragraph). Plan to expand profile building and effectiveness of crawling/scraping. Very rough draft.
